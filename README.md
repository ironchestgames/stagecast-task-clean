# Fredrik Järnbröst's solution to Stagecast tech test

I've only touched `src/price-calculator.js` and `spec/price-calculator.specs.js` (apart from adding a `.gitattributes` file and this README.)

Below are some changes that I think would be of benefit (both dev and maintenance-wise) if the project was planned to get medium/big.

- Add package managing, e.g. npm
- Add development server, e.g. serve
- Build js and remove inline js, e.g. babel/browserify
- Convert to ES6 and use transpiler, e.g. babel
- Add linting
- Build test runner page, e.g. mocha reporter "doc"
- Add rules engine for business logic flexibility
